# Phonecave

This project is the backend version of a 3h technical interview in which I was asked to create a front end + an API for a website which displays a list of mobile phones, showing the details of each of those according to an initial JSON file. This part was built in REACT, using REACT components, bootstrap designs and services for routing. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and run the frontend version of the project to view it working in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Deployment

This project isn't currently deployed, so in order to run it you will have to open it in your local code editor or from terminal.

### Content
This is a basic backend API for a frontend project.

What you will find here is a functional auth and rooting for a website project in which you can see a list of phones and their details. 
You will also find a model for each of those phones, with all the details required, and it's server to be .

The initial idea was that anyone could see the list, and click into each phone to see the details.
After login you should be able to see in your profile your saved ones.

This is not a finished project, it's just a test of what I am capable to do today, 23rd March 2023. You can check this was done within 3h in the commits!

There is also a frontend repository in my github for this project.

Thank you!
